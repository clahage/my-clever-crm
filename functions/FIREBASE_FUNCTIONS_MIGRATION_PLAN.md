# Firebase Functions v2+ Migration Plan

## 1. Upgrade `firebase-functions` (DONE)
- Upgraded to latest version using `npm install --save firebase-functions@latest` in `/functions`.

## 2. Migrate from `functions.config()` to `.env` (REQUIRED by March 2026)
- Identify all uses of `functions.config()` in your Cloud Functions codebase.
- Replace with environment variables using `.env` files and `process.env`.
- See: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/config-env#migrate-to-dotenv

## 3. Update Code
- Refactor all code using `functions.config()` to use `process.env`.
- Add `.env` files for local and production secrets.

## 4. Test and Deploy
- Test all functions locally with `firebase emulators:start`.
- Deploy with `firebase deploy --only functions`.

## 5. Remove Legacy Config
- Remove any legacy config from Firebase console after migration.
