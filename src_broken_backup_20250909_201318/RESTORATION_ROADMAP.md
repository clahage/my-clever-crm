# RESTORATION ROADMAP

## PRIORITIES
1. Restore missing navigation sections (Tools & Utilities, IDIQ, full 6-section structure)
2. Rebuild incomplete modules (Analytics, Billing, Calendar, Communications, Export, Bulk, Automation, User Management, Roles & Permissions)
3. Integrate live OpenAI API and activate webhooks/AI automation
4. Restore sophisticated dashboard widgets and enterprise analytics

## DEPENDENCIES
- Navigation restoration required before module access
- OpenAI integration depends on backend endpoint readiness
- Analytics dashboard requires data pipeline and module restoration
