ExpandLess and ExpandMore are not valid Lucide icon exports. Use 'ChevronUp' and 'ChevronDown' instead for expand/collapse functionality.

Reference: https://lucide.dev/icons/

Replace:
import { ExpandMore, ExpandLess } from 'lucide-react';

With:
import { ChevronDown, ChevronUp } from 'lucide-react';

And update usages accordingly.
