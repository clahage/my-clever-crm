## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT IN 3 STEPS

### **Step 1: Copy Files (2 minutes)**

```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd "C:\SCR Project\my-clever-crm"

# Copy the templates file
Copy-Item "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\emailTemplates.js" -Destination "functions\emailTemplates.js" -Force

# Copy the workflow engine (note the rename!)
Copy-Item "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\emailWorkflowEngine-MEGA-ENTERPRISE-COMPLETE.js" -Destination "functions\emailWorkflowEngine.js" -Force
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Rename `emailWorkflowEngine-MEGA-ENTERPRISE-COMPLETE.js` to just `emailWorkflowEngine.js` when copying!

### **Step 2: Update functions/index.js (5 minutes)**

Open `functions/index.js` and add these exports:

```javascript
// Add at the top with other requires
const {
  startWorkflow,
  processScheduledStages,
  getWorkflowStatus,
  sendManualEmail,
  SendGridService
} = require('./emailWorkflowEngine');

// Add these function exports

// 1. Trigger workflow when contact created
exports.onContactCreated = functions.firestore
  .document('contacts/{contactId}')
  .onCreate(async (snap, context) => {
    const contactId = context.params.contactId;
    const contactData = snap.data();
    
    try {
      console.log(`🎯 New contact created: ${contactId}`);
      await startWorkflow(contactId, contactData);
      console.log(`✅ Workflow started successfully`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('❌ Error starting workflow:', error);
    }
  });

// 2. CRITICAL: Process scheduled stages every 15 minutes
exports.processWorkflowStages = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('every 15 minutes')
  .timeZone('America/Los_Angeles')
  .onRun(async (context) => {
    console.log('⏰ Processing due workflow stages...');
    try {
      await processScheduledStages();
      return null;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('❌ Scheduled processing error:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  });

// 3. Handle SendGrid webhook events
exports.handleSendGridWebhook = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const events = req.body;
    
    if (Array.isArray(events)) {
      for (const event of events) {
        await SendGridService.handleWebhookEvent(event);
      }
    }
    
    res.status(200).send('OK');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook error:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error');
  }
});
```

### **Step 3: Deploy (3 minutes)**

```powershell
# Verify config (should show SendGrid and OpenAI keys)
firebase functions:config:get

# Deploy
firebase deploy --only functions

# Watch the deployment
# Should take 2-3 minutes
```

**Expected output:**
```
✔  functions: Finished running predeploy script.
i  functions: preparing functions directory for uploading...
✔  functions: functions folder uploaded successfully
i  functions: updating functions...
✔  functions[onContactCreated]: Successful update operation.
✔  functions[processWorkflowStages]: Successful create operation.
✔  functions[handleSendGridWebhook]: Successful create operation.
✔  Deploy complete!
```

## 🧪 TESTING (5 minutes)

### **Create Test Contact**

Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) → Firestore → contacts → Add document:

```json
{
  "firstName": "Test",
  "lastName": "User",
  "name": "Test User",
  "emails": [
    {
      "address": "YOUR-EMAIL@gmail.com",
      "isPrimary": true
    }
  ],
  "phones": [
    {
      "number": "8887247344",
      "isPrimary": true
    }
  ],
  "leadSource": "website_test",
  "contactType": "lead",
  "leadScore": 7,
  "urgencyLevel": "medium",
  "createdAt": [timestamp - use "timestamp" type],
  "updatedAt": [timestamp - use "timestamp" type]
}
```

### **Check Logs**

```powershell
firebase functions:log --only onContactCreated
```

**Expected:**
```
🎯 New contact created: [ID]
✅ SendGrid initialized
✅ OpenAI initialized
🚀 Starting workflow for contact: [ID]
📋 Selected workflow: Website Lead Flow
✅ Workflow initialized
⚡ Executing: Welcome Email (Stage 1/5)
✅ Email sent to YOUR-EMAIL@gmail.com: Welcome to Speedy Credit Repair
✅ Workflow started successfully
```

### **Check Your Email**

Within 60 seconds, you should receive a professional welcome email from Chris Lahage!

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CHECKLIST

Your system is working when:

- [ ] Test contact created in Firestore
- [ ] No errors in Firebase logs
- [ ] Welcome email received in inbox
- [ ] Contact document shows `workflowState` with status "active"
- [ ] `communications` collection has email record
- [ ] Next stage scheduled (visible in contact document)

---

## 📊 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

### **Immediate (0-60 seconds)**
- Contact created → Workflow starts automatically
- Welcome email sent via SendGrid
- Firestore updated with workflow state
- First stage complete

### **15 Minutes Later**
- `processWorkflowStages` cron job runs
- Checks for any due stages
- (Your test contact's next stage is 12 hours away, so nothing happens yet)

### **12 Hours Later**
- Cron job finds your contact's stage is due
- Sends "Value Add" email automatically
- Schedules next stage (24 hours total)

### **Ongoing**
- Every 15 minutes: System checks for due stages
- Emails sent automatically
- Opens/clicks tracked
- A/B testing optimizes over time
- Analytics update continuously

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **"SendGrid API key not configured"**
```powershell
firebase functions:config:set sendgrid.key="YOUR_KEY"
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### **"No email address"**
- Contact must have `emails` ARRAY: `[{ address: "...", isPrimary: true }]`
- Not just `email` field

### **"getEmailTemplate is not a function"**
- Verify `emailTemplates.js` is in `functions/` directory
- Redeploy: `firebase deploy --only functions`

### **Workflow not starting**
- Check logs: `firebase functions:log --only onContactCreated`
- Verify `leadSource` matches workflow entry conditions
- Check contact has email address

### **Stages not executing on schedule**
- Verify `processWorkflowStages` is deployed
- Check it's running: `firebase functions:log --only processWorkflowStages`
- Should run every 15 minutes

---

## 📞 NEED HELP?

### **Option 1: Check Logs**
```powershell
# All functions
firebase functions:log

# Specific function
firebase functions:log --only onContactCreated

# Recent errors
firebase functions:log --only onContactCreated --limit 50
```

### **Option 2: Start New Claude Chat**
1. Upload the handoff document
2. Explain the issue
3. Share relevant logs
4. New Claude will have full context!
