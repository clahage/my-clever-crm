**Last Updated:** October 12, 2025 (Session 2 - In Progress)  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Navigation & File Cleanup  
**Project Owner:** Chris Lahage (newbie coder - needs explicit instructions)

## ⚡ QUICK STATUS (60-SECOND BRIEFING)

**What Just Happened:**
- ✅ Built accordion navigation (8 role levels)
- ✅ Created mega contact form (50+ fields, AI features)
- 🔴 DEBUGGING: Form won't render (no errors)

**Current Blocker:**
MegaContactForm component doesn't show on screen despite correct import and state. Likely JSX placement issue in Contacts.jsx.

**Next Claude Should:**
1. Debug rendering issue (see Known Issues section)
2. Complete Phase 1 tasks
3. Continue to Phase 2 workflows

**Jump To:**
- [Known Issues](#-known-issues-priority-debug) - Active bugs
- [Debug Checklist](#-immediate-debug-checklist) - Fix steps
- [Current Tasks](#-current-session-tasks) - Status overview
- [Session Log](#-session-log) - What was just done

---

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE DEBUG CHECKLIST

When the next Claude session starts, do this FIRST:

### **Step 1: Request These Files**
```
Please paste:
1. Last 100 lines of src/pages/Contacts.jsx
2. Console output after refreshing the page (F12 → Console)
```

### **Step 2: Add Debug Code**
Ask user to add this AFTER line 28 in Contacts.jsx:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('🔍 showMegaForm:', showMegaForm);
  console.log('🔍 MegaContactForm:', MegaContactForm);
  console.log('🔍 Type:', typeof MegaContactForm);
}, [showMegaForm]);
```

### **Step 3: Verify JSX Structure**
The MegaContactForm block MUST be structured like this:
```javascript
      {/* Other content */}
      
      {showMegaForm && (
        <MegaContactForm
          onClose={() => setShowMegaForm(false)}
          onSuccess={(newContact) => {
            console.log('New contact created:', newContact);
            fetchContacts();
            setShowMegaForm(false);
          }}
        />
      )}
    </div>  // ← Closes main container
  );  // ← Closes return statement
};  // ← Closes component function

export default Contacts;
```

### **Step 4: Quick Fix Test**
If structure looks wrong, provide exact line numbers to fix placement.

## 🚨 KNOWN ISSUES (PRIORITY DEBUG)

### **ISSUE #1: MegaContactForm Not Rendering** 🔴
**Status:** Active debugging in progress  
**Severity:** High (blocks form functionality)

**Symptoms:**
- Form component doesn't appear on screen
- No errors in browser console
- No errors in VSCode
- showMegaForm state = true (confirmed)
- Button click works (verified)

**What We've Verified:**
- ✅ File exists: `src/components/forms/MegaContactForm.jsx`
- ✅ Import correct: `import MegaContactForm from '@/components/forms/MegaContactForm';`
- ✅ State added: `const [showMegaForm, setShowMegaForm] = useState(true);`
- ✅ Bugs fixed: Duplicate setLoading, missing imports
- ✅ Button changed to trigger showMegaForm

**What We Haven't Verified:**
- ⏳ JSX placement in Contacts.jsx (need last 100 lines to confirm)
- ⏳ Component is INSIDE return statement (not outside)
- ⏳ Console logs from debug code (user hasn't run yet)

**Debug Steps for Next Claude:**
1. Request last 100 lines of Contacts.jsx
2. Verify MegaContactForm is placed BEFORE `</div>` (inside return)
3. Add console.log debug code to verify component loads
4. Check if `typeof MegaContactForm === 'function'`
5. Try removing conditional `{showMegaForm &&` to test if component renders at all

**Possible Causes:**
- Most likely: JSX placed outside component return statement
- Less likely: Import path issue (but path verified correct)
- Unlikely: React rendering issue (would show console error)

## 📌 CRITICAL CONTEXT (READ FIRST)

This is a **live production credit repair CRM** built with React + Firebase + Vite. The project owner is a beginner coder who needs:
- ✅ **Complete code files** (no placeholders or truncations)
- ✅ **Exact line numbers** for all edits
- ✅ **Before/after examples** showing changes
- ✅ **Step-by-step installation instructions**
- ✅ **Testing checklists** for verification

**Communication Style:**
- Use exact line numbers: "Insert AFTER line 47:"
- Provide complete code blocks ready to copy/paste
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Never say "rest of code here" or similar truncations

## 🔐 AUTHENTICATION & ROLES

### **Current Auth System:**
- Firebase Authentication
- Role stored in Firestore `userProfiles` collection
- AuthContext provides: `user`, `userProfile`, `loading`, `logout()`

### **Role Assignment:**
**For Master Admin (you):**
```javascript
// You can see everything and control everything
userProfile.role = 'masterAdmin'
```

**For New Users:**
- Default: `prospect` (limited access until assigned client#)
- Upgrade to `client` when onboarded
- `user` for employees
- `admin` for team leaders
- `manager` for department heads
- `affiliate` for partners
- `viewer` for read-only access

### **Individual User Overrides:**
**Planned Feature:** UserPermissionsManager.jsx
- Override default role permissions
- Grant/revoke specific features per user
- Custom navigation visibility
- Time-based access rules

---

2. ✅ Test on desktop (Chrome, Firefox)
3. ✅ Test on mobile (responsive)
4. ✅ Test all user roles (masterAdmin, admin, user, client, prospect)
5. ✅ Test navigation accordion behavior
6. ✅ Test dark mode toggle
7. ✅ Test role-based visibility
8. ✅ Check browser console for errors
9. ✅ Test Firebase connections
10. ✅ Verify imports resolve correctly

### **Before Deployment:**
1. ✅ Run `npm run build` - Check for build errors
2. ✅ Test production build locally (`npm run preview`)
3. ✅ Verify all environment variables set
4. ✅ Test Firebase authentication
5. ✅ Test Firestore reads/writes

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES TO REMEMBER

### **1. Master Contact List Integration**
**Required:** All forms should access centralized contact database
- Auto-complete existing contacts
- Prevent duplicate entries
- Populate fields from selected contact
- AI suggestions for similar contacts

### **2. Prospect vs Client Distinction**
**Business Rule:**
- `prospect` = Interested but not onboarded (no client#)
- `client` = Onboarded with active service (has client#)
- Prospects can view limited pages
- Upgrade to client when contract signed + payment setup

### **3. Zipcode Auto-Populate**
**Implementation:**
- Use API (Google Places, USPS, or Zippopotam.us)
- Auto-fill city, state, county on zipcode entry
- Validate zipcode format (5 digits or 5+4)
- Handle invalid zipcodes gracefully

### **4. Name Pronunciation Feature**
**Accessibility Feature:**
- Text-to-speech for name pronunciation
- Playback button next to name fields
- Helps with difficult/unique names
- Stores pronunciation preference

### **5. AI Lead Scoring**
**Business Intelligence:**
- Score contacts 1-100 based on:
  - Engagement level
  - Credit score range
  - Financial capacity indicators
  - Response time/interest
- AI observations and recommendations
- Prioritize high-value leads

## 📋 CURRENT SESSION TASKS

### **COMPLETED:** ✅
1. ✅ Navigation system with accordion behavior (only one group open at a time)
2. ✅ 8-level role hierarchy (masterAdmin → viewer)
3. ✅ Role-based navigation filtering
4. ✅ Mobile-optimized navigation
5. ✅ MegaContactForm.jsx created (50+ fields, AI scoring, pronunciation)
6. ✅ Fixed bugs in MegaContactForm (duplicate setLoading, missing imports)
7. ✅ Updated Contacts.jsx (import, state, button, form placement)
8. ✅ PROJECT_HANDOFF.md created and updated

### **IN PROGRESS:** 🔄
1. 🔄 **DEBUGGING:** MegaContactForm not rendering (no console errors)
   - File location verified: src/components/forms/MegaContactForm.jsx
   - Import verified: Line 2 of Contacts.jsx correct
   - State added: showMegaForm = true
   - Component placement: Added to Contacts.jsx
   - **ISSUE:** Nothing shows on screen, no errors in console
   - **NEED:** Check last 100 lines of Contacts.jsx for proper JSX structure
   - **NEED:** Verify placement is INSIDE return statement, not outside

### **PENDING:** ⏳
1. ⏳ Complete remaining steps of MegaContactForm (Steps 3 & 4)
2. ⏳ File cleanup (delete duplicates, merge content)
3. ⏳ AI-enhanced document implementations (12 files)
4. ⏳ Naming consistency audit
