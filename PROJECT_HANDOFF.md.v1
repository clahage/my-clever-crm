## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### **✅ Issue 1: Functions Export Error** (FIXED)
**Error:** `does not provide an export named 'functions'`
**Solution:** Added to `src/lib/firebase.js`:
```javascript
import { getFunctions } from 'firebase/functions';
export const functions = getFunctions(app);
```
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### **✅ Issue 2: Analytics Error** (FIXED)
**Error:** `getAnalytics is not defined`
**Solution:** Added to `src/lib/firebase.js`:
```javascript
import { getAnalytics } from 'firebase/analytics';
let analytics = null;
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  analytics = getAnalytics(app);
}
export { analytics };
```
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### **⏳ Issue 3: Firestore Indexes** (PENDING)
**Error:** May occur on first query: "The query requires an index"
**Solution:** 
1. Firebase Console will show link to create index
2. Click the link
3. Wait 2-5 minutes for index to build
4. Queries will work after that
**Affected queries:**
- `contacts` where `temperature` == X and `status` == 'new'
- `paymentTransactions` where `type` == 'zelle' and `status` == 'pending-confirmation'
**Status:** ⏳ Will happen on first deploy

### **⏳ Issue 4: Email Not Sending** (PENDING SETUP)
**Cause:** Email service not configured yet
**Solutions:**
- **Option A:** Install Firebase Email Extension
  ```bash
  firebase ext:install firebase/firestore-send-email
  ```
- **Option B:** Configure SendGrid
  ```bash
  firebase functions:config:set sendgrid.key="YOUR_KEY"
  ```
**Status:** ⏳ Needs configuration after deployment

### **⏳ Issue 5: Webhook Not Receiving** (PENDING UPDATE)
**Cause:** AI Receptionist still pointing to Pipedream
**Solution:** Update webhook URL in AI Receptionist admin:
- Old: `https://eolfouk1amrfslz.m.pipedream.net/`
- New: `https://us-central1-my-clever-crm.cloudfunctions.net/receiveAIReceptionistCall`
**Status:** ⏳ Needs manual update after deployment
