**Benefits:**
- ✅ Everything related to one function is in one place
- ✅ No hunting through menus
- ✅ Each hub is self-contained and fully featured
- ✅ Easy to train staff on specific hubs they'll use

### Role-Based Access

Different user roles see different features:

| Role | Access Level | Typical Use Case |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Master Admin** | Full system access | Business owner, system administrator |
| **Admin** | All operational features | Office manager, senior staff |
| **Manager** | Team & client management | Team leads, supervisors |
| **User** | Standard operations | Front-line staff, processors |
| **Client** | Client portal only | Your customers |
